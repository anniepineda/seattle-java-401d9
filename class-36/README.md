## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- Whiteboard practice in lecture
- Doing the Hard Stuff with AWS
  - I'm thrilled to hear this.

### The Mixed

- Android is hard and there's a lot going on.
  - Yes.
  - For some, this is a rise-to-the challenge moment.
    - drawing pictures of how functions relate
    - building a second app on the side to practice basic welcome-to-Android concepts
  - But for others, more of a cause of stress/concern.
    - You don't have to explain how everything works, deep down, to be able to write code.
      - you think I know how all of AWS works?!? definitely not.
    - Especially with AWS errors, reach out for help early; sometimes, there will be deeper structural issues.
      - account setup!
      - permissions!
      - An AWS dev I trust has told me that 80% of AWS development time is spent dealing with IAM.

### The Bad/The Least Helpful

- A few people feeling burned out/tired
  - I hope your weekend included sleep!
  - Remember that taking a break is an important step towards having a successful next day.
