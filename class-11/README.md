## Agenda

* Announcements
    * Don't forget that career coaching is coming on Friday!
    * Canvas updated its gradebook over the weekend, and it has subtly altered some assignments. If anything seems off, or if TAs aren't doing re-grades, please let us know--we're all learning/adjusting to it on the fly.
    * Feedback review
* Code review
    * Stacks & Queues
* Daily Systems: Windows vs Mac vs Linux
* Lecture
    * Using the Spring Initializr
    * Hello, Internet
    * Running Web Apps: Ports, IntelliJ, and other things you will yell at
    * MVC Revisited
* Lab intro

## Warmup Questions

1. What is a path, on the internet?
2. What is a method, in HTTP?
3. What is a route?
4. What is the job of a server?

## Learning Objectives

* Students will be able to configure a Java project with Spring dependencies.
* Students will be able to start a local server that serves static content.
* Students will be able to write controllers with routes that carry in information via URL parameters.
* Students will be able to deploy their Spring server to Heroku and access it.

## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

* Showing cool/weird/interesting solutions during code review
* Code challenges & whiteboards
* Lecture, and having video of lecture (especially with snow)
* The TAs and Michelle
    * <3 y'all we love you too

### The Bad/The Least Helpful

* Readings (fine)
* Wanting more depth/coverage on whiteboarding & code challenges
    * I hear you--those things are the fun part for me.
    * I don't have secret curriculum I can point you at, but feel free to use Code Wars (or your own knowledge) to make up problems to ask each other!
    * We'll have practice interviews with Michelle/TAs during midterm project week.
    * In the second half of the course (or maybe even in the next couple of weeks), we'll also do some practice whiteboarding in front of the class.
